# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

This repository has solutions to some problems of Project Euler.

We used [import.io](https://import.io/) to fetch all the Project Euler 
problems into a list, then we sorted them by their level of difficulty and 
solved some in R and Python.

## Strategy

We value simplicity, memory efficiency, speed optimization, and - as much 
as possible - using only built-in functions.
