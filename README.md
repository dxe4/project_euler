# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

This repository has my solutions to some problems of Project Euler.

I used [import.io](https://import.io/) to fetch all the Project Euler 
problems into a list, then I sorted them by their level of difficulty and 
solved some of them in R, later I'll do it in Python as well.

I recommend checking my solutions for problems 3, 5, 7, 8.

## Strategy

I privilege simplicity, memory efficiency, speed optimization, and using 
only built-in functions.
