# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

This repository has my solutions to some problems of Project Euler.

I used [import.io](https://import.io/) to fetch all the Project Euler 
problems into a list, then I sorted them by their level of difficulty and 
solved some of them in R, later I'll do it in Python as well.

For the solutions in R, check folder R. The same reasoning applies for Python.

## Strategy

I value simplicity, memory efficiency, speed optimization, and - as much 
as possible - using only built-in functions.
